# AlgoGo

This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Go. It serves as a reference for learning and understanding these fundamental computer science concepts.

## Data Structures

for now this are the implementations, but more should come...

### Linear Data Structures
- **Linked List**: `linked_list.go`
- **Double Linked List**: `double_linked_list.go`
- **Stack**: `stack.go` (with tests in `stack_test.go`)
- **Queue**: `queue.go` (with tests in `queue_test.go`)
- **Priority Queue**: `priority_queue.go` (with tests in `priority_queue_test.go`)

### Non-linear Data Structures
- **Binary Tree**: `binary_tree.go`
- **Hash Map**: `hash_map.go`

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: `bubble_sort.go` (with tests in `bubble_sort_test.go`)
- **Insertion Sort**: `insertion_sort.go` (with tests in `insertion_sort_test.go`)
- **Selection Sort**: `selection_sort.go` (with tests in `selection_sort_test.go`)
